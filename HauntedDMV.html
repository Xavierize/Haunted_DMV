            <h2> 3206 G St NW </h2>

            It is said that a murder occurred within this home. 
            However, that did not stop a buyer from purchasing the home in 2013. </p>

           <h2>Rock Creek Park</h2>
           <p>This park is about 32 miles in length going all throughout the District of columbia
              and leaking into Montgomery County. Although the park has beautiful scenary, there is a sense of eeriness within the park.
               With mutliple trails paths and lots of wilderness, it is easy to get lost with you do not know where youa are going</p>
